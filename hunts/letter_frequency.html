<h2>Letter Frequency</h2>

<p>Take the sentence:</p>

<p>"Hidden behind veighty vines both Huey 'n Beth dive, head-bobbing in bubble baths."</p>

<p>and sort the letters by how frequently they appear (most frequently first).</p>

<p>Then find the two words in the first 8 characters.</p>

<p>So if you had the sentence:</p>

<p>"Calculating crooks taste acck!"</p>

<p>The word that exists in the first 3 most frequent characters is "CAT".</p>

<p>The frequencies would be:</p>

<p>["c", 5]</p>
<p>["a", 4]</p>
<p>["t", 3]</p>
<p>["l", 2]</p>
<p>["o", 2]</p>
<p>["k", 2]</p>
<p>["s", 2]</p>
<p>["u", 1]</p>
<p>["i", 1]</p>
<p>["n", 1]</p>
<p>["g", 1]</p>
<p>["r", 1]</p>
<p>["e", 1]</p>
